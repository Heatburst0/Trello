## When you open the app for the first time

When a user opens the app for the first time, it will encounter an intro screen that will give the user two options: sign in if the user is already registered or sign up to register using their name, email address, and password.

## App drawer and user profile view

The app's drawer offers users the choice to either sign out and return to the intro screen or access their profile to update personal details, including picture, name, and phone number.

After signing in to the app, users will be directed to the home screen of the app, where they can access boards that they have created or been assigned to.
<br />
<br />
Users can create boards by clicking on the add/plus button located at the bottom-right of the home screen.
<br />
<br />
Only name and a board image are required to create a board.

## Create Tasks and assign members to the board

<br />
After creating a board, users can create task lists on the board by clicking the add list button and specifying the name of the task list. Users can also change the name of the task list or delete a task list.
<br />
<br />

Users can assign multiple people to a board by entering their email addresses. Those added to the board will receive a notification on their phone about it.
<br />
<br />
## Add and customise cards in the task list

<br />

Once you've made a task list, you can put cards on it to represent different kinds of work. These cards are customisable - you can change their color labels, assign them to specific board members, set deadlines, and even move them around within the list. It's a flexible way to organise and manage your tasks effectively.
